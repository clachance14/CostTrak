## Test Scenarios

### 1. Access Control Tests

#### 1.1 Role-Based Access
- ✅ **Controller**: Full access to all change orders
- ✅ **Executive**: Read-only access to all change orders
- ✅ **Ops Manager**: Create/edit/approve/reject change orders (with $50k limit)
- ✅ **Project Manager**: Create/edit change orders for own projects only
- ✅ **Accounting**: Read-only access to all change orders
- ✅ **Viewer**: No access - redirected to unauthorized page

#### 1.2 Project-Based Access
- ✅ Project managers can only see change orders for their assigned projects
- ✅ Other roles can see all change orders across all projects

### 2. CRUD Operations Tests

#### 2.1 Create Change Order
Test as **pm1@ics.ac**:
- ✅ Create form displays with project dropdown (only shows PM's projects)
- ✅ CO number auto-generates in format CO-001, CO-002, etc.
- ✅ Required fields validation:
  - Project (required)
  - CO Number (required, must match CO-XXX format)
  - Description (required, min 10 chars, max 500 chars)
  - Amount (required, cannot be zero)
- ✅ Optional fields:
  - Schedule Impact Days (defaults to 0)
  - Submitted Date (defaults to today)
- ✅ Status defaults to "pending" for non-approval roles
- ✅ Audit trail entry created on save

#### 2.2 Edit Change Order
Test as **pm1@ics.ac**:
- ✅ Can edit pending change orders for own projects
- ✅ Cannot edit approved/cancelled change orders (no edit button shown)
- ✅ Cannot edit other PMs' change orders
- ✅ Project field is disabled in edit mode
- ✅ Audit trail updated with changes

#### 2.3 Delete Change Order
Test as **controller@ics.ac**:
- ✅ Only controllers can delete change orders
- ✅ Cannot delete approved change orders
- ✅ Confirmation prompt before deletion
- ✅ Soft delete (deleted_at timestamp set)
- ✅ Audit trail entry created

### 3. Approval Workflow Tests

#### 3.1 Ops Manager Approval (<= $50k)
Test as **opsmanager@ics.ac**:
- ✅ Create CO for $25,000 - can approve
- ✅ Create CO for $49,999 - can approve
- ✅ Create CO for $50,000 - can approve
- ✅ Create CO for $50,001 - cannot approve (error: "Change orders over $50,000 require controller approval")
- ✅ Approved COs update project's revised_contract automatically

#### 3.2 Controller Approval (Any Amount)
Test as **controller@ics.ac**:
- ✅ Can approve any amount (tested with $1,000,000)
- ✅ No approval threshold limits

#### 3.3 Rejection Flow
Test as **opsmanager@ics.ac**:
- ✅ Rejection requires reason (prompt dialog)
- ✅ Rejected COs show rejection reason in audit trail
- ✅ Project manager receives notification of rejection
- ✅ Can re-edit and resubmit rejected change orders

### 4. Financial Integration Tests

#### 4.1 Contract Value Updates
- ✅ Original contract remains unchanged
- ✅ Revised contract = Original + Sum of Approved COs
- ✅ Database trigger automatically updates on approval
- ✅ Updates reflected immediately in:
  - Project detail page financial summary
  - Project manager dashboard
  - Executive dashboard
  - API responses

#### 4.2 Financial Calculations
Test with project having:
- Original Contract: $1,000,000
- Approved CO #1: +$50,000
- Approved CO #2: +$25,000
- Rejected CO #3: +$100,000 (not counted)
- Pending CO #4: +$30,000 (not counted)

Results:
- ✅ Revised Contract: $1,075,000
- ✅ Total Change Orders: $75,000
- ✅ Only approved COs affect contract value

### 5. UI/UX Tests

#### 5.1 List Page
- ✅ Pagination (20 items per page)
- ✅ Search by CO number or description
- ✅ Filter by status (all/pending/approved/rejected/cancelled)
- ✅ Project-specific filtering via query param
- ✅ Sortable columns
- ✅ Quick approve/reject buttons for pending COs
- ✅ Status badges with appropriate colors

#### 5.2 Detail Page
- ✅ Full change order information displayed
- ✅ Project information with link
- ✅ Financial impact clearly shown
- ✅ Audit trail with user names and timestamps
- ✅ Approve/Reject buttons for authorized users
- ✅ Edit button for pending COs only

#### 5.3 Form Validation
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback
- ✅ CO number format validation (CO-XXX)
- ✅ Amount formatting with currency symbol
- ✅ Description character limits
- ✅ Error messages are clear and helpful

### 6. Edge Cases Tests

#### 6.1 Duplicate CO Numbers
- ✅ System prevents duplicate CO numbers per project
- ✅ Error: "CO number already exists for this project"
- ✅ Different projects can have same CO numbers

#### 6.2 Negative Change Orders
- ✅ Negative amounts allowed (deductive change orders)
- ✅ Approval thresholds apply to absolute value
- ✅ -$60,000 requires controller approval (exceeds $50k threshold)
- ✅ Revised contract correctly reduced by negative COs

#### 6.3 Zero Amount
- ✅ Zero amount not allowed
- ✅ Validation error: "Amount cannot be zero"

#### 6.4 Schedule Impact
- ✅ Positive values = delays
- ✅ Negative values = acceleration
- ✅ Zero = no impact
- ✅ Displayed correctly in UI

### 7. Notification Tests

#### 7.1 Large Change Order Notifications
Test with system setting large_co_threshold = $100,000:
- ✅ CO >= $100,000 triggers notifications to controllers and executives
- ✅ Notification includes project name, CO number, and amount

#### 7.2 Approval/Rejection Notifications
- ✅ Project manager notified when their CO is approved
- ✅ Project manager notified when their CO is rejected (with reason)
- ✅ Notifications include relevant details and links

### 8. Audit Trail Tests

- ✅ All actions logged: create, update, approve, reject, delete
- ✅ User identification preserved
- ✅ Timestamps accurate
- ✅ Changes tracked with before/after values
- ✅ Rejection reasons stored
- ✅ Displayed in reverse chronological order

### 9. Performance Tests

- ✅ No noticeable lag when updating contract values

### 10. Integration Tests

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **CSV Import**: Not yet implemented (planned feature)
2. **Bulk Operations**: No bulk approve/reject functionality
3. **Email Notifications**: Currently only in-app notifications
4. **Attachments**: No document attachment support yet
5. **Change Order Templates**: No template functionality

## Business Rule Compliance

✅ **Email Domain**: Only @ics.ac emails allowed
✅ **Approval Thresholds**: $50k limit for ops managers enforced
✅ **Status Workflow**: Proper transitions enforced
✅ **Soft Deletes**: No hard deletes, deleted_at used
✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all changes
✅ **Financial Integrity**: Automatic contract updates via trigger
✅ **Role Hierarchy**: Proper permission escalation

## Security Tests

- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Role-based access control enforced
- ✅ Project-based filtering for PMs
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- ✅ XSS prevention (React sanitization)
- ✅ CSRF protection (Supabase tokens)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Document the $50k approval threshold prominently in UI
   - Add loading states for approval/rejection actions
   - Consider adding CO revision/amendment functionality

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Implement CSV import with validation
   - Add bulk approval for multiple small COs
   - Create CO templates for common changes
   - Add document attachment capability
   - Implement email notifications
   - Add CO categories/types for reporting

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Consider pagination for audit trails on busy projects
   - Add caching for project dropdown data
   - Optimize change order list query for large datasets
