# Vercel Deployment Debugging Guide

## Recent Changes

I've simplified the build process to fix the Vercel deployment failure. Here's what was changed:

### 1. Reverted to Standard Build Command
- `vercel.json` now uses `pnpm build` instead of the custom verbose script
- Removed the middleware function configuration that might have been causing issues

### 2. Added Inline Build Logging
- `next.config.ts` now logs environment information at build time
- This will show in Vercel's build logs without any custom scripts

### 3. Created Helper Scripts (for manual debugging)
- `pnpm build:info` - Shows build environment details
- `pnpm build:verbose` - Detailed build with diagnostics (use locally)
- `pnpm build:diagnose` - Pre-build validation

### 4. Added .vercelignore
- Prevents unnecessary files from being uploaded to Vercel
- Excludes test scripts and local development files

## What to Look for in Vercel Logs

When the deployment runs, you'll see:

1. **Next.js Config Loading** section showing:
   - Build timestamp
   - Node version
   - Environment (should show `Vercel: Yes`)
   - Environment variables status
   - Working directory

2. **Build Process**:
   - Should show "Creating an optimized production build..."
   - Any TypeScript or build errors will appear here

## If Deployment Still Fails

1. **Check the Build Logs** in Vercel dashboard for:
   - Missing environment variables (marked with âœ—)
   - TypeScript compilation errors
   - Module resolution issues

2. **Common Issues**:
   - **Missing env vars**: Ensure all variables are set in Vercel dashboard
   - **Module not found**: Check if all dependencies are in package.json
   - **TypeScript errors**: The build currently ignores these, but they're still logged

3. **Manual Debugging**:
   - Use Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod` to test deployment locally
   - Run `pnpm build:info` locally to compare with Vercel environment
   - Check if `.env.local` values match Vercel environment variables

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to trigger a new deployment
2. Monitor the Vercel dashboard for the build logs
3. Look for the "Next.js Config Loading" section to verify environment
4. If it fails, the error should be clearly visible in the logs

## Rollback Plan

If you need to investigate further:
1. Update `vercel.json` to use `"buildCommand": "pnpm build:info && pnpm build"`
2. This will show detailed environment info before the build starts

The simplified approach should work as it removes complexity and uses Next.js standard build process.
