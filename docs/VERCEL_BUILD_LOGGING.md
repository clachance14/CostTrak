# Vercel Build Logging Enhancement

## Overview

I've created an enhanced build logging system to help diagnose deployment issues on Vercel. This system provides detailed insights into the build process, environment, and potential issues.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Build Script (`scripts/vercel-build.js`)
- Comprehensive environment variable checking
- File system validation
- Middleware analysis
- Detailed timing information
- Color-coded output for better visibility
- Error capturing with full stack traces

### 2. Build Diagnostics Tool (`scripts/build-diagnostics.ts`)
- TypeScript configuration validation
- Middleware compilation testing
- Supabase type checking
- Dependency verification
- Build environment analysis

### 3. Updated Configuration
- Modified `package.json` with new build scripts
- Updated `vercel.json` to use verbose build command
- Added middleware function configuration

## Usage

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run diagnostics only
pnpm build:diagnose

# Run verbose build (includes diagnostics)
pnpm build:verbose

# Standard build (unchanged)
pnpm build
```

### What Gets Logged

1. **Environment Variables**
   - All required Supabase variables (values redacted for security)
   - Vercel-specific variables
   - Build environment details

2. **File System**
   - Critical files presence and size
   - Directory structure validation
   - Middleware file analysis

3. **Middleware Analysis**
   - Import validation
   - TypeScript compilation check
   - Edge runtime configuration

4. **Dependencies**
   - Version checking for critical packages
   - Compatibility warnings (e.g., @supabase/ssr with Next.js 15)

5. **Build Process**
   - Timestamped steps
   - Duration tracking
   - Success/failure status with details

## Debugging Deployment Issues

When a deployment fails, the enhanced logs will show:

1. **Pre-Build Phase**
   - Environment variable availability
   - File system state
   - TypeScript compilation issues

2. **Build Phase**
   - Exact error messages with stack traces
   - Which step failed and when
   - Full command output

3. **Post-Build Analysis**
   - Build output validation
   - Middleware chunk verification

## Key Findings from Testing

1. **TypeScript Path Alias Issue**
   - The middleware compilation test shows: `Cannot find module '@/types/database.generated'`
   - This suggests the TypeScript path alias might not be resolved correctly during isolated compilation

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Local testing shows missing env vars (expected when .env.local is not loaded)
   - Vercel should inject these during build

3. **@supabase/ssr Compatibility**
   - Version 0.6.1 has known issues with Next.js 15
   - Consider upgrading to 0.7.0-rc.2 if problems persist

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy with verbose logging** to see detailed output in Vercel dashboard
2. **Monitor the build logs** for:
   - Environment variable presence
   - Middleware compilation success
   - Any unexpected errors

3. **If deployment still fails**, the logs will pinpoint:
   - Exact error location
   - Missing dependencies or configuration
   - Environment-specific issues

## Rollback Option

If you need to disable verbose logging:
1. Change `vercel.json` buildCommand back to `"pnpm build"`
2. The standard build process will be used

## Additional Notes

- The verbose build adds ~5-10 seconds to build time
- All sensitive values (API keys) are automatically redacted in logs
- Logs are visible in Vercel dashboard under the deployment details
- Color codes might not appear in Vercel logs but structure remains clear
