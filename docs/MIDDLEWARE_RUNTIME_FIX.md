# Middleware Runtime Fix - 500 Error Resolution

## Problem

The Vercel deployments were showing as "Ready" (builds succeeding) but the application was returning 500 errors with `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED`. This is a **runtime error**, not a build error.

## Root Cause

The middleware was throwing unhandled errors that crashed the Edge Runtime:

1. **Line 32**: `throw new Error('Missing required environment variables')` - This would crash if env vars were missing
2. **Catch block**: Always redirected to `/login`, even for public routes, potentially causing loops
3. **No safety checks**: The middleware didn't handle edge cases gracefully

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Graceful Environment Variable Handling
```typescript
// OLD - Would crash runtime
if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  throw new Error('Missing required environment variables')
}

// NEW - Returns early without crashing
if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  console.error('Middleware: Missing Supabase environment variables')
  console.error('Middleware: Continuing without auth due to missing env vars')
  return response
}
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling
```typescript
// Added check for public routes in catch block
if (publicRoutes.some(route => pathname === route) || pathname.startsWith('/api/auth/')) {
  return response
}
```

### 3. Prevent Redirect Loops
```typescript
// Added check to prevent login redirect loop
if (!user) {
  if (pathname === '/login') {
    return response
  }
  // ... redirect logic
}
```

### 4. Updated Middleware Matcher
```typescript
// Excludes API routes from middleware processing
matcher: [
  '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|public|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)',
]
```

## Key Changes Summary

1. **No More Throws**: Removed all `throw` statements that could crash the runtime
2. **Early Returns**: Added early returns for missing configurations
3. **Public Route Protection**: Ensures public routes work even when errors occur
4. **Loop Prevention**: Prevents infinite redirect loops
5. **API Exclusion**: API routes bypass middleware entirely

## Testing

The middleware now:
- ✅ Handles missing environment variables gracefully
- ✅ Allows public routes to function regardless of auth state
- ✅ Prevents redirect loops
- ✅ Logs errors without crashing
- ✅ Excludes API routes from processing

## Deployment

Push these changes to trigger a new deployment. The 500 errors should be resolved as the middleware no longer crashes the Edge Runtime.

## Monitoring

After deployment, check:
1. Vercel Functions logs for any remaining errors
2. Application loads without 500 errors
3. Authentication still works for protected routes
4. Public routes are accessible
