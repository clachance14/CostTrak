# Multi-Division Budget Tracking Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Analysis ✓
- Analyzed existing schema structure
- Identified that projects currently have single division_id
- Found existing divisions: Mechanical, I&E, Civil, Industrial, Service, Environmental
- Discovered discipline field in project_budget_breakdowns for mapping

### 2. Database Schema Design ✓
Created comprehensive design document (`/docs/division-tracking-schema-design.md`) including:
- Project-division many-to-many relationship via `project_divisions` table
- Division-specific budgets, PMs, and forecasts
- Discipline to division mapping strategy
- Craft type to division associations
- PO division assignment based on creator's division

### 3. Migration Scripts ✓
Created three migration files:

#### `/supabase/migrations/20250121_multi_division_support.sql`
- Core tables: project_divisions, division_discipline_mapping, craft_type_divisions
- Added division_id to all cost tracking tables
- Created division_budgets and division_forecasts tables
- Set up aggregation views and trigger functions
- Populated initial discipline mappings

#### `/supabase/migrations/20250121_multi_division_rls_policies.sql`
- Row-level security for all new tables
- Division-based access control policies
- Helper functions for permission checks
- Updated policies for existing cost tracking tables

#### `/supabase/migrations/20250121_multi_division_data_migration.sql`
- Maps craft types to divisions
- Migrates existing budget breakdowns to division budgets
- Updates cost tracking records with division assignments
- Creates initial division forecasts
- Includes validation queries and performance indexes

### 4. API Endpoints ✓
Created division-aware API endpoints:

#### `/app/api/projects/[id]/divisions/route.ts`
- GET: List project divisions with budgets and costs
- POST: Add division to project
- PATCH: Update division assignment
- DELETE: Remove division from project

#### `/app/api/projects/[id]/divisions/[divisionId]/budget/route.ts`
- GET: Get division budget with breakdowns
- PUT: Update division budget
- POST: Import budget from breakdowns

#### `/app/api/projects/[id]/divisions/[divisionId]/forecast/route.ts`
- GET: Get division forecast with calculations
- POST: Create/update division forecast
- Includes forecast history tracking

#### `/app/api/purchase-orders/by-division/route.ts`
- GET: List POs with division filtering and access control
- POST: Create PO with automatic division assignment
- PATCH: Bulk reassign PO divisions

## Key Features Implemented

### Division Mapping Logic
- **I&E Division**: Electrical, Instrumentation disciplines
- **Civil Division**: Grout, Civil-related disciplines  
- **Mechanical Division**: Piping, Equipment, Steel, Fabrication (default)
- POs assigned to divisions based on creator's division

### Access Control
- **Controllers/Executives**: Full access to all divisions
- **Ops Managers**: Access to their assigned division only
- **Division PMs**: Manage their specific division within projects
- **Accounting**: Can enter labor actuals across divisions

### Financial Tracking
- Division-specific budgets with category breakdowns
- Automatic rollup to project totals via triggers
- Division cost summaries with variance analysis
- Forecast tracking with history

### Data Migration
- Existing projects maintain current division as lead
- Budget breakdowns mapped to appropriate divisions
- Cost data assigned based on mappings
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Next Steps

The following tasks remain to complete the implementation:

1. **Update Project Forms** - Add multi-division selection UI
2. **Create Division Views** - Tabbed interface for division details
3. **Business Rules** - Implement alerts and thresholds
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Reports** - Division performance analytics

## Running the Migrations

To apply these changes to your database:

```bash
# Run migrations in order
pnpm supabase migration up --file 20250121_multi_division_support.sql
pnpm supabase migration up --file 20250121_multi_division_rls_policies.sql  
pnpm supabase migration up --file 20250121_multi_division_data_migration.sql

# Generate new TypeScript types
pnpm generate-types
```

## Testing the Implementation

After running migrations, test the division features:

1. Query division assignments: `SELECT * FROM project_divisions`
2. Check division budgets: `SELECT * FROM division_budgets`
3. Verify cost summaries: `SELECT * FROM division_cost_summary`
4. Test API endpoints with different user roles
5. Validate RLS policies are working correctly
