## 2025-07-29: Comprehensive 3-Level WBS Hierarchy Implementation

**ID:** DEC-007
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Controllers, Estimating Department, Project Managers, Development Team

### Decision

Implement a comprehensive 3-level WBS hierarchy (01-99 major categories) with full multi-sheet Excel integration, using BUDGETS sheet as the single source of truth for costs while other sheets provide clarity and detail.

### Context

Construction projects require detailed cost breakdown across multiple dimensions. The estimating department uses standardized Excel coversheets with specific sheets for different cost categories. Manual mapping of these to a WBS structure is error-prone and time-consuming. Projects need standardized categorization for variance analysis and reporting.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple 2-Level WBS**
   - Pros: Easier to implement, faster processing
   - Cons: Insufficient detail for variance analysis, no drill-down capability

2. **Dynamic WBS from Excel**

   - Cons: No standardization across projects, difficult to compare

3. **Fixed 4-Level WBS**
   - Pros: Maximum detail, finest granularity
   - Cons: Over-complex for most projects, difficult navigation

### Rationale

The 3-level structure (Major Category → Sub-Category → Detail Item) provides the right balance of detail and usability. Using BUDGETS as the cost source prevents double-counting while other sheets add valuable context. The 01-99 numbering system allows for future expansion while maintaining consistency.

Key design decisions:
- **Parent Groupings**: MECHANICAL (includes STEEL, EQUIPMENT, PIPING, etc.), CIVIL (includes CONCRETE, GROUNDING, etc.), I&E (includes INSTRUMENTATION, ELECTRICAL)
- **Staff Phases**: 4 phases (JOB SET UP, PRE-WORK, PROJECT, JOB CLOSE OUT) with 23 indirect roles each
- **Direct Labor**: 39 standardized categories from DIRECTS sheet
- **Materials**: Separate tracking of TAXED, NON-TAXED, and TAXES
- **Cost Truth**: BUDGETS sheet is authoritative; other sheets provide detail only

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Standardized WBS across all projects enables portfolio analysis
- Automatic classification of 1000+ line items saves 20+ hours per project
- Detailed variance analysis capability at every level
- Preserves estimating department workflow
- Drill-down from project totals to individual roles/items
- Parent discipline groupings simplify executive reporting

**Negative:**
- Initial complexity in parsing logic development
- Dependency on Excel structure consistency
- Training required for discipline mapping rules
- Potential reconciliation issues if sheets don't align
