## Pitch

CostTrak saves project managers 15-20 hours per week by replacing manual Excel consolidation with three simple imports: one-time budget setup, and weekly labor and PO updates. Track your project's true cost position in real-time with automatic Direct/Indirect labor classification.

## Users

### Primary User

**Project Manager** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Project Manager responsible for P&L
- **Context:** Manages project finances, receives weekly Excel files from accounting, subcontractors, and field teams
- **Pain Points:** Spends 15-20 hours/week consolidating Excel data, manual Direct/Indirect classification, delayed visibility into cost overruns
- **Goals:** Upload weekly data in <5 minutes, trust the numbers, see real-time budget vs actual

### Secondary Users

**Finance Team** (35-50 years old)
- **Role:** Reviews consolidated project financials
- **Context:** Needs reliable data for forecasting and reporting
- **Goals:** Access accurate, up-to-date project costs without manual work

## The Problem

Project managers waste 15-20 hours weekly consolidating project financial data from siloed Excel files to get an accurate cost vs. budget view. While budgets are entered once at project start, labor costs and PO commitments arrive weekly via email attachments. This manual process is time-consuming, error-prone, and delays critical business decisions.

**Our Solution:** Three simple imports - Budget (once), Labor (weekly), and POs (weekly) - with automatic validation and a real-time dashboard.

## Differentiators

### Weekly Import Workflow
Unlike complex ERP systems, we focus on the PM's actual workflow: get Excel files weekly, upload them, see the impact immediately.

### Direct/Indirect Auto-Classification
Automatically classify labor as Direct or Indirect based on employee data, eliminating manual categorization errors.

### One-Time Budget, Weekly Actuals
Budgets are set once. Weekly imports track the burn. No complex revision workflows - just simple, clear tracking.
