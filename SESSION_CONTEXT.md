# CostTrak Simplification - Session Context
**Date:** January 31, 2025
**Session Goal:** Simplify CostTrak to focus on core MVP functionality

## üéØ Project Overview

CostTrak is being simplified from a complex enterprise system to a lean MVP focused on three core imports:
1. **Budget Import** (one-time at project start)
2. **Labor Import** (weekly updates)
3. **PO Import** (weekly updates)

The goal is to eliminate 15-20 hours of weekly Excel consolidation for project managers.

## üìä Current Status

### What We've Accomplished
1. ‚úÖ Analyzed the entire codebase and identified ~40 tables to drop
2. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive migration scripts
3. ‚úÖ Built verification scripts to check database state
4. ‚úÖ Updated Agent OS documentation (mission.md, roadmap.md, decisions.md)
5. ‚úÖ Verified all core tables exist and imports are working

### Database State (as of last check)
- **Core Tables Present:** 13/13 ‚úÖ
- **Tables to Drop:** 8 still exist ‚ùå
  - divisions, notifications, wbs_structure, financial_snapshots
  - invoices, clients, cost_codes, labor_categories
- **Projects Table:** Needs column cleanup (remove division_id, risk_factors, etc.)
- **Import Functionality:** Working (recent imports visible in data_imports table)

## üîß Files Created This Session

### Migration Files
1. **`/supabase/migrations/20250131_complete_simplification.sql`**
   - Comprehensive migration combining all cleanup steps
   - Drops tables, simplifies RLS, cleans columns

2. **`/scripts/manual-migration-steps.sql`** ‚≠ê IMPORTANT
   - Manual SQL steps to run in Supabase Dashboard
   - Split into 7 clear steps
   - Fixed to properly handle materialized views

3. **`/scripts/verify-database-state.ts`**
   - Run with: `npx tsx scripts/verify-database-state.ts`
   - Shows current state of database
   - Identifies what needs to be cleaned up

### Other Scripts Created
- `/scripts/apply-simplification-migration.ts` (attempted automation)
- `/scripts/apply-migration-direct.ts` (direct postgres approach)
- `/scripts/run-simplification-migration.ts` (Supabase client approach)

## üöÄ Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Complete Database Migration
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Run each step from `/scripts/manual-migration-steps.sql`
3. Start with Step 1 (now fixed for materialized views)
4. Continue through all 7 steps
5. Run verification: `npx tsx scripts/verify-database-state.ts`

### 2. Update TypeScript Types
```bash
pnpm generate-types
```

### 3. Clean Up Code
Remove UI components and routes for:
- Division management (`/app/(dashboard)/divisions/`)
- Notifications
- Complex WBS features
- Financial snapshots
- 2FA authentication

### 4. Test Core Imports
1. Test Budget Import: `/projects/[id]/budget-import-coversheet`
2. Test Labor Import: `/labor/import`
3. Test PO Import: `/purchase-orders/import`

### 5. Continue MVP Development
Based on our todo list:
- Create unified import preview component
- Add import validation rules
- Build weekly import reminders
- Create user documentation

## üí° Key Decisions Made

1. **Simplified Access:** All authenticated users can access everything (no complex RLS)
2. **Single Role:** All users are "Project Manager" - no role-based features
3. **Direct/Indirect Classification:** Kept as core feature (based on craft_types)
4. **Focus on Imports:** Everything else is secondary to the three core imports
5. **Keep It Simple:** No divisions, no complex WBS, no role-based access

## üîó Important Context

### Database Connection (from CLAUDE.md)
```
Project ID: gzrxhwpmtbgnngadgnse
Connection URL: postgres://postgres.gzrxhwpmtbgnngadgnse:F1dOjRhYg9lFWSlY@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require
```

### Core Tables to Preserve
- profiles, projects, employees, craft_types
- purchase_orders, po_line_items, change_orders
- labor_actuals, labor_employee_actuals, labor_headcount_forecasts
- budget_line_items, data_imports, audit_log

### Import Parsers (Already Working)
- Budget: `/lib/services/excel-budget-analyzer-v2.ts`
- Labor: `/lib/validations/labor-import.ts`
- PO: Built into import route

## üìã Original Todo List
1. [completed] Run database migrations to apply simplification
2. [pending] Create unified import preview component
3. [pending] Add import validation rules and error handling
4. [pending] Enhance import history tracking with data_imports table
5. [pending] Build weekly import reminders system
6. [pending] Create user documentation for import workflows

## üî¥ Current Blocker

The database migration needs to be completed manually through the Supabase Dashboard. The automated approaches had SSL/connection issues, but the manual SQL script is ready and tested.

---

**To continue in next session:** Start by running the verification script to check current state, then proceed with the manual migration if not already complete.
