Architecture Overview
CostTrak is an internal financial tracking system for industrial construction projects built with:

Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)
UI Components: Radix UI (@radix-ui/react-*), shadcn/ui components
Form Handling: react-hook-form, zod (validation)
State Management: @tanstack/react-query (TanStack Query)
Icons & Visualization: lucide-react, recharts
File Handling: xlsx (Excel import/export), react-dropzone
Date/Time: date-fns
Security: argon2 (password hashing), speakeasy (2FA)
Notifications: sonner (toast notifications)
Database Schema
Core tables with Row Level Security (RLS):

profiles: User profiles with role-based access (controller, executive, ops_manager, project_manager, accounting, viewer)
projects: Central entity with job_number as unique identifier
purchase_orders & po_line_items: Track committed costs
change_orders: Contract modifications with approval workflow
financial_snapshots: Pre-calculated metrics for performance dashboards
labor_actuals: Weekly actual labor costs and hours by craft type
labor_headcount_forecasts: Future headcount projections
craft_types: Labor categories (direct, indirect, staff)
documents: File management with categories (general, safety, financial, legal, technical, other)
notifications: User notification system with read/archived status
Key Business Rules
Email Domain: Only @ics.ac emails allowed (enforced at database level)
Job Numbers: Unique project identifiers, must be preserved during imports
Access Control: Division-based for ops managers, project-based for PMs
Financial Calculations: Revised contract = original + approved change orders
Soft Deletes: Use status fields, never hard delete
Environment Variables
Required in .env.local:

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN=ics.ac
Development Patterns
Type Safety: Generate types from database schema when schema changes
RLS Policies: All database access must respect row-level security
Audit Trail: Use audit_log table for tracking sensitive changes
Performance: Use financial_snapshots for dashboard queries
Excel Import: Preserve legacy PO numbers and job numbers during import
API Patterns:
Use Zod schemas for request/response validation
Implement consistent error handling with proper HTTP status codes
Use React Query for client-side data fetching and caching
Apply rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
Component Architecture:
Use shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
Implement variant system for component styling (size, variant props)
Follow compound component pattern for complex UI elements
Form Handling:
Use react-hook-form with Zod validation
Implement progressive enhancement for forms
Show loading states during async operations
Security Best Practices:
Use Argon2 for password hashing (via Supabase auth)
Implement CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
Validate all user inputs on both client and server
Never expose sensitive data in client-side code
State Management:
Use React Query for server state
Use React Context for global UI state
Implement optimistic updates for better UX
Cache API responses appropriately

Code Style Guidelines
Use camelCase for variables and functions; PascalCase for components, interfaces, and types.
Follow TypeScript best practices: Always add explicit type annotations; prefer interfaces for props and state; use generics for reusable components.
Import statements: Group Next.js/React imports first, then third-party (e.g., @tanstack/react-query, lucide-react), then local; use absolute imports via aliases (e.g., @/components/Button, @/lib/supabase).
JSX: Apply Tailwind classes directly; use cn() utility from shadcn/ui for conditional classes; avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
Error handling: Use try-catch in async functions; return standardized error objects (e.g., { error: 'message', status: 400 }); integrate with sonner for user-facing toasts.
Dates: Use date-fns for all manipulations; store and transmit in ISO format; format for display with consistent locale (e.g., en-US).
IMPORTANT: Enforce ESLint and Prettier rulesâ€”no unused vars, consistent single quotes, required semicolons; use Zod for schema validation in APIs and forms.
Workflow Instructions
After schema changes: Run pnpm db:migrate followed by pnpm generate-types to update types; then pnpm lint and pnpm type-check.
Before commits: Execute pnpm lint, pnpm type-check, and (once configured) pnpm test; seed DB with pnpm db:seed for local testing.
Testing: Prioritize unit tests for utils and components (Jest + React Testing Library); integration tests for APIs with Supabase mocks; cover edge cases like invalid emails, unauthorized access, or large file uploads.
Deployment: Build via pnpm build; deploy to Vercel/Netlify; verify RLS, 2FA, and notifications post-deploy; use Turbopack for dev speed.
For imports/exports: Validate data with Zod against business rules (e.g., unique job numbers, email domains) before DB insertion; handle large Excel files in chunks.
Branching: Feature branches as 'feature/[description]'; bug fixes as 'fix/[description]'; rebase onto main and squash commits before merging PRs.
Environment Setup and Dependencies
Node.js: v20+ required; manage packages exclusively with pnpm (avoid yarn/npm).
Supabase: Local via Docker (pnpm db:start); use supabase CLI for schema management; service role key for admin ops only.
Key dependencies: @supabase/supabase-js for DB/auth; react-hook-form + zod for forms; @tanstack/react-query for data; recharts for visualizations; react-dropzone for uploads.
Dev tools: VS Code with extensions for ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind IntelliSense, React, and Supabase.
Note: Avoid raw SQLâ€”use Supabase client methods for RLS safety; argon2 is handled by Supabase auth, so no direct imports needed.
Quirks: Large xlsx imports may cause memory issuesâ€”implement streaming if needed; ensure 2FA secrets are never logged.
Core Files and Utilities
src/lib/supabase.ts: Central client setup for auth/DBâ€”import this for all interactions.
src/types/supabase.ts: Auto-generated DB typesâ€”reference for type safety in queries.
src/components/ui/: shadcn/ui and Radix-based components (e.g., Button, Dialog)â€”extend these for consistency.
src/utils/financial-calculations.ts: Helpers for metrics like revised contracts or variance analysisâ€”reuse across features.
src/hooks/useProjectQuery.ts: Custom React Query hooks for fetchingâ€”build on these for data management.
@business-rules.md: Optional linked doc for expanded rules if this section grows.
Unexpected behavior: Recharts may need explicit sizing for responsive dashboardsâ€”wrap in containers; dropzone rejects invalid files automatically, but add custom validation.
Custom Rules
YOU MUST enforce RLS: Query as authenticated user; test changes with various roles (e.g., viewer vs. controller).
Security: Validate inputs with Zod on client/server; use optimistic updates in React Query but rollback on errors; enable 2FA checks in auth flows.
Performance tip: Leverage financial_snapshots for queries; use React Server Components for initial loads; debounce search inputs.
Warning: Soft deletes require status updates and audit loggingâ€”avoid DELETE ops; preserve job numbers in all imports.
Accessibility: Add ARIA attributes to Radix components; ensure forms are keyboard-navigable; use semantic HTML.
UX: Integrate sonner toasts for all async ops; show skeletons during loading; implement infinite scrolling for long lists if needed.
Financial accuracy: Trigger snapshot regeneration after PO/CO/labor updates; use precise decimal handling (e.g., BigInt for currencies if needed).
